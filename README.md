# lametric-air-now
[Air Now](https://www.airnow.gov/) air quality reports for [LaMetric](lametric.com) using the [Air Now API](http://.airnowapi.org)

# Reason
My wife is obsessed with the air quality reports, i tried to put this together a while back but LaMetric had not yet added config params to their UIs and the geo-ip thing seemed to tiring to attempt.

# Tech
I wanted to do a Travis-CI continuous deployment to heroku deal for this, and it seemed like node.js with express was the easiest way to do this, so that's what i did.
